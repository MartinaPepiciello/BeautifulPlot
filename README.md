# Fractals and Times Tables Visualization

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for visualizing fractals and modular times tables using Matplotlib/Pyplot, along with custom color maps for enhanced visual representation.

## Contents

- `fractals.ipynb`: A notebook dedicated to drawing various fractals using L-systems. It includes interactive widgets for customizing the fractal parameters such as the axiom, rules, turning angle, and more.
